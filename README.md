## Project description
This project investigates tourist sentiment and preferences by analyzing a large dataset of extracted tweets related to travel experiences. By leveraging sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we aim to identify the factors influencing tourists' positive and negative experiences.

## Methodology
This project utilizes a five-component framework to analyze tourist sentiment and preferences from social media data:

**(a) Data Acquisition:**
This component focuses on collecting relevant social media data, typically tweets in our case. It may involve utilizing web scraping library like snscrape, beautiful soup and selenium,  employing keyword and hashtag searches to identify travel-related content within a specific timeframe.

**(b) Data Preprocessing:**
Raw social media data often contains noise and inconsistencies. This component addresses these issues by cleaning the text data. Techniques like removing irrelevant characters, normalizing text (e.g., converting to lowercase), and stemming/lemmatization (reducing words to their base form) are commonly used for data preparation.

**(c) Data Labeling and Sentiment Analysis:**
This component classifies the preprocessed data based on sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). We can leverage pre-trained sentiment analysis models like RoBERTa, LSTM and BERT. This allows us to understand the emotional tone of tourists' travel experiences and ultimately classify them into positive and negative sentiment classes.

**(d) Topic Modeling:**
This component delves deeper into the thematic structure of the data. Techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) help identify underlying topics associated with positive and negative sentiment. This unveils the factors influencing tourists' experiences, providing valuable insights.

**(e) Visualization:**
Data visualization plays a crucial role in presenting findings effectively. Charts, graphs, and word clouds can be used to visually represent the distribution of sentiment, prominent topics, and relationships between them. This facilitates clear communication of the project's results.

By systematically processing and analyzing social media data through these components, we gain a comprehensive understanding of tourist sentiment and preferences, ultimately leading to actionable insights for the tourism industry.

## Key findings
1. Our analysis revealed a sentiment distribution of almost 85% positive sentiment and 15% negative sentiment.
2. Positive Trends:
  * 2018 saw the most positive tweets, indicating a period of high tourist satisfaction. 
  * The United States had the most positive tweets, suggesting generally positive experiences for American tourists.
3. Negative Trends:
  * 2011 had the most negative tweets, implying a period of widespread tourist dissatisfaction.
  * Bosnia had the most negative tweets, suggesting tourists from Bosnia had frequent negative experiences.

## Insights and Actions
These findings offer valuable insights for the tourism industry:
1. Location-based Analysis:
Identifying locations with high positive sentiment can help promote those destinations.
2. Temporal Analysis:
Understanding trends over time can help identify periods of decline and areas for improvement.

## Project Impact
These findings offer valuable insights for the tourism industry. Destinations can use this knowledge to:
  * Improve competitiveness by addressing factors influencing negative sentiment (e.g., enhancing safety measures).
  * Tailor their offerings to better cater to tourist preferences identified through positive sentiment analysis.
